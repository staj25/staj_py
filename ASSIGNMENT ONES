#Interesting Result if done this way
#Results are broken into seperate elements of letters in the list instead of whole words
#Eureka!! I see why!! 
#That's what List substitution is meant to do - take each element and add it as a seperate element in a List
#so each element that starts with s is being put in the list as a seperate element!
