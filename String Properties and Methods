#STRINGS ARE IMMUTABLE i.e. you can't change them using indexing  
#e.g. the code below that tries to replace a letter in a string on idex 0, will give you an error!
#name = "Sam"
#name[0] = 'P'

#To do the above you have to use concatenating i.e. merging 2 strings

name = 'Sam'

last_letters = name[1:]
print(last_letters)

print('\n')


print('P' + last_letters)

print('\n')


x = 'Hello World'


print(x + " it is beautiful outside!")

print('\n')

#mulitplication with letters, below gives u 10 z's

letter = 'z'
print(letter * 10)

print('\n')

# *** NOTE **** you can't concatenate numbers with strings
#e.g. the below will not calc and give you 5 as the result
print('2' + '3')
print('\n')


####  METHODS 
# Upper Methods - converts string into upper case likewise lower method
print(x.upper())
print(x.lower())
print('\n')



## Split Method - Create a list from a string
#split is done based on the space delimiter by default
# **** remember from above x = 'Hello World'

x.split()
print(x.split())

print('\n')

#this uses 'i' as a delimiter
y = 'Hi this is a string'
print(y.split('i'))
